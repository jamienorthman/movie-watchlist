# Movie Watchlist
Searches for movies using the Open Movie Database API and saves selected movies to a watchlist using localStorage.

## Notes 
A free-tier api key is used to practice working with APIs on the frontend. Normally access keys such as this would be hidden server side, or at the very least in a gitignore file, but in this instance it is just used for learning purposes. As I progress into more fullstack applications, this repo may be deleted with a new one created to reflect more secure practices. 

## Built with
- Async JavaScript
- HTML / CSS
